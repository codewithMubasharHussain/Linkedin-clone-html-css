**Description**
This is my second project, a LinkedIn clone built with HTML and CSS. This project includes a front page and a profile page to replicate the familiar layout and features of LinkedIn. Both pages have dropdown menus for a realistic and interactive user experience.

**Features**
Front Page: A mockup of LinkedInâ€™s landing page, designed to look familiar to users. It includes sections for sign-in and sign-up options, featured posts, and networking highlights.
Profile Page: A sample user profile layout, with sections for the profile picture, bio, connections, posts, and activity feed.
Dropdown Menus: Both the front page and profile page include dropdown menus, offering options for navigation and additional settings.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling the layout, dropdown menus, and responsive design elements.

**Future Improvements**
Add interactivity using JavaScript for dropdown menu functionality and other user interactions.
Implement additional pages like Messages, Notifications, and a job listings page.
